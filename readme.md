This script is part of the Kabyle NLP project. 
The script returns the schema of a verb given as input:

for example: for verb "gzem" (to cut), the verb schema would be "C1C2eC3"
If a verb has the same consonant twice, the C code would be the same for the consonant

For exemple: "ifsis" (be light) : iC1C2iC2
